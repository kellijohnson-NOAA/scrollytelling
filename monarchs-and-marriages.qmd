# English Monarchs and Marriages

By Nicola Rennie

:::

Data from [ianvisits.co.uk](https://www.ianvisits.co.uk/articles/a-list-of-monarchs-by-marriage-6857/) lists the ages of [**monarchs**]{style="color:#508080;"} and their [**consorts**]{style="color:#E30B5C;"} at the time of marriage. Monarchs (who have historically mostly been male) are typically older than their consorts and *'it was not that uncommon for older monarchs to be married off to quite young women if needing a replacement queen after the previous model had been inconvenient enough to drop dead'*. 

<br>
*Only marriages where the monarch's age, the consort's age, and the 
year of marriage are known are included here. A further 27 marriages are included 
in the full data where the dates or ages are unknown or uncertain.
