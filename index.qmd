Scrollytelling is a digital storytelling technique that uses interactive scrolling to reveal content, animations, or data in a dynamic and engaging way as the user scrolls down a webpage.

These examples are built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and the [Closeread extension](https://closeread.netlify.app/).
